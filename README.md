# GitHubPractice #

## This is the Read Me file for the GitHubPractice repository on GitHub. ##

GitHub recognizes this Read Me file as a markdown file. When you look at it on this page GitHub displays it a particular way using the markdown syntax.

1. Fork this repository and look at this Read Me file in a text editor to see what the markdown looks like.

   Here's a resource to get you started with markdown: [http://commonmark.org/help/](http://commonmark.org/help/)

2. Using your favorite text editor create a .html, .css, or other file. Add some lines of code. Save it. Then back in your bash program (I use Terminal) add the file to the staging area. Then add a commit comment. Lastly push it up to the repository.

3. Now using only your bash program create a file and add a line of text to it. Again use the bash commands to add it to the staging area, add a commit comment, and lastly push it up to the repository.

4. Now do the same exact thing as the two previous steps, only in your repository. Don't use your text editor and do not use your bash program. Use only https://github.com/[your github account]/GitHubPractice
