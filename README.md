## This is the Read Me file for the GitHubPractice repository on GitHub. ##

GitHub recognizes this Read Me file as a markdown file. When you look at it on this page GitHub displays it a particular way using the markdown syntax.

1. Clone this repository and look at this Read Me file in a text editor to see what the markdown looks like.

Here's a resource to get you started with markdown: [http://commonmark.org/help/](http://commonmark.org/help/)

2. Using your favorite text editor create a .html, .css, or other file. Add some lines of code. Save it. Then back in your bash program (I use Terminal) add the file to the staging area. Then add a commit comment. Lastly push it up to the repository.
